# Rewrite all branches to modify the date of one specific commit in a repo.

# Sample date format: Fri Jan 2 21:38:53 2009 -0800
# ISO8601 and RFC822 dates will also work.
#
# Note: filter-branch is picky about the commit argument. As of 1.7.0.4,
# a hex ID will work, the symbolic revision HEAD will fail silently,
# and the usability of more exotic rev specs was not tested by the author.
