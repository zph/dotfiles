description: Initialize a repository with my preferred way of doing CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md files
---

Initialize the repository with agent configuration files:

1. Create a CLAUDE.md file in the repository root that points to an AGENTS.md file
2. Create AGENTS.md if it doesn't exist
3. If AGENTS.md doesn't exist, prefill it with sensible boilerplate for the project

The CLAUDE.md file should contain instructions that tell Claude Code to refer to AGENTS.md for agent-specific configuration and tasks.

The AGENTS.md file should include:
- A description of the repository/project
- Common agent tasks and workflows
- Project-specific conventions and guidelines
- Any relevant configuration or setup instructions
- Links to important documentation or resources

Make sure to check if these files already exist before creating them to avoid overwriting existing content.
