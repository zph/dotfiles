# Design-Driven Development

This skill guides a structured design-driven development workflow. The goal is to get alignment on what you're building *before* writing code, which dramatically reduces rework and misunderstandings.

## Critical Rule: Stop and Iterate

**STOP after completing each phase.** Present the document to the user for review. Incorporate their numbered feedback. Only proceed to the next phase when explicitly approved.

This is the most important part of the workflow. Don't rush through design to get to code.

## Workflow Overview

1. **High-Level Design (HLD)** - Project vision and architecture
2. **Low-Level Design (LLD)** - Component-specific technical design
3. **EARS Specifications** - Requirements with semantic IDs
4. **Implementation Plan** - Phases, checkboxes, Definition of Done

## When to Use This Workflow

**Consult this skill for ALL code changes.**

**Full workflow (create new docs) for:**
- New features
- Major refactors
- Significant behavior changes

**Coherence check only (skip doc creation) for:**
- Bug fixes
- Quick changes (<30 minutes)
- Debugging sessions

Even when skipping doc creation, verify intent coherence: do existing specs, tests, and code align? If not, fix the docs before changing the code.

**If unsure, use the full workflow.** Over-designing is safer than under-designing.

## Phase 1: High-Level Design

Check if a project HLD exists first: `/docs/high-level-design.md`

For new projects or major features, create an HLD covering:
- Problem statement and goals
- Target users and personas
- System architecture overview
- Key design decisions and trade-offs
- Non-goals (what's explicitly out of scope)

**Stop and get user approval before proceeding.**

## Phase 2: Low-Level Design

Create component-specific LLDs in `/docs/llds/` for each major component.

See [lld-templates.md](references/lld-templates.md) for structure guidance.

Key principles:
- **Narrative format** for complex constraint interactions
- **Structured format** for API contracts and interfaces
- Include data models, error handling, edge cases
- Reference the HLD for context
- **LLDs are pure design documents** — they describe *how* things work but do not track implementation status

**Stop and get user approval before proceeding.**

## Phase 3: EARS Specifications

Generate requirements using EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax).

See [ears-syntax.md](references/ears-syntax.md) for full syntax reference.

Key principles:
- **Semantic spec IDs**: `{FEATURE}-{TYPE}-{NNN}` (e.g., `AUTH-UI-001`, `CART-API-003`)
- Create in `/docs/specs/` (e.g., `user-authentication-specs.md`)
- Each requirement is testable and traceable
- Spec files carry status markers: `[x]` implemented, `[ ]` active gap, `[D]` deferred
- **Delete specs that are no longer wanted** — git preserves history

**Stop and get user approval before proceeding.**

## Phase 4: Implementation Plan

Create execution plan in `/docs/planning/` with date suffix.

See [plan-templates.md](references/plan-templates.md) for structure guidance.

Key elements:
- **Phases** with clear deliverables
- **Checkboxes** for tracking progress
- **Spec ID references** tying to EARS requirements
- **Definition of Done** with verification criteria
- **Testing requirements** with spec annotations

**Stop and get user approval before proceeding.**

## Maintaining Intent Coherence

### The Arrow of Intent

There's a chain of documents that translates intent from vision to working code:

```
HLD → LLDs → EARS → Tests → Code
```

Each level translates the previous into more specific terms:
- **HLD** says *what* and *why*
- **LLDs** say *how* at a component level
- **EARS** says *exactly what must be true* in testable terms
- **Tests** verify those truths
- **Code** makes them real

These aren't independent documents—they're a single expression of intent at different levels of specificity.

### The Problem: Intent Drift

Intent drifts over time. User clarifies something and the LLD gets updated but not the EARS. A test gets fixed but the spec still says the old thing. The HLD evolves but nobody touches downstream docs.

Eventually the levels disagree. The code works, but doesn't match the specs. The specs pass review, but don't match the design. The chain breaks.

### The Principle: Coherence Over History

The arrow of intent must stay coherent. When one level changes, downstream levels must be reviewed and updated to match.

**Mutation, not accumulation.** Update docs in place. Delete what's wrong. The documentation should always reflect *current* intent—not the history of how intent evolved.

### The Practice: Cascade Changes Downward

When requirements or understanding change:

1. **Identify the entry point** - Where in the chain does this change originate?
2. **Update at that level** - Mutate the doc directly
3. **Cascade downward** - Review and update each subsequent level:
   - HLD change → review LLDs → review EARS → review tests → review code
   - LLD change → review EARS → review tests → review code
   - EARS change → review tests → review code
4. **Delete what's obsolete** - Delete specs that no longer apply (don't mark them, just remove); remove tests for removed specs

### Before Implementation

Before implementing (or resuming implementation), verify coherence:

- Do the EARS specs trace to the current LLD?
- Do the tests trace to current EARS?
- If drift is detected, fix the docs first—then implement.

## Code Annotation Pattern

Annotate code with `@spec` comments linking to EARS IDs:

```typescript
// @spec AUTH-UI-001, AUTH-UI-002, AUTH-UI-003
export function LoginForm({ ... }) {
  // Implementation
}
```

Test files also reference specs:

```typescript
// @spec AUTH-UI-010
it('validates email format before submission', () => {
  expect(validateEmail('invalid')).toBe(false);
});
```

This creates traceability from requirements → code → tests.

## Progress Tracking

During implementation:
- Check off items in the implementation plan as completed
- Update the plan doc with any discovered changes
- Move completed phases to an `/old/` subdirectory when fully done

## Why This Works

| Benefit | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| **Forced checkpoints** | Catches misunderstandings before you've built the wrong thing |
| **Scannable docs** | One-line requirements easy to search and reference |
| **Traceability** | @spec annotations link code to requirements |
| **Survives session breaks** | Docs persist, context doesn't get lost |
| **Reusable** | Same docs work across multiple sessions |
| **Testable requirements** | EARS format ensures requirements are verifiable |
