# Implementation Plan Templates

Implementation plans provide checkbox-based execution guides tied to EARS specifications.

## File Location

Create plans in `/docs/planning/` with date suffix:
- `user-authentication-implementation-plan.2025-01-15.md`
- `checkout-flow-refactor.2025-02-01.md`

Move completed plans to `/docs/planning/old/` when finished.

## Risk Assessment Table

Include for each phase:

```markdown
## Risk Assessment

### High Risk

**1. Third-party auth provider outage**
- **Mitigation**: Implement fallback to email/password
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation with user notification

### Medium Risk

**2. Token refresh race conditions**
- **Mitigation**: Mutex lock on refresh, queue pending requests
- **Fallback**: Force re-login on conflict
```
