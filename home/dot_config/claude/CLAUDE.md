# Instructions

1. Always use TDD approach to building
2. EARS design using our ears skill
3. Tag ears spec ids onto the code area worked on for a given task
4. Use docs/ folder for understanding the project and keep an upto date IMPLEMENTATION.md doc

**Remember:**
- 🧪 Test first, EARS always, trace everything
- 🎯 Test behavior, not implementation
- 📋 **Always update IMPLEMENTATION.md**
- 🔄 Red-Green-Refactor loop is mandatory
- Technical choices for algorithms and distributed systems behavior should focus on the tradeoffs involved and use research skill.
