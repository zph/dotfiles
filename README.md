My dotfiles

Here's an explanation of the organization of files:

[Blog Post About Dotfiles](https://blog.xargs.io/2013/02/getting-started-configuring-bashzsh/)

Use at your own risk ;).

Installation
===
```shell
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/zph/zph.git ~/dotfiles
gem install homesick
homesick symlink ~/dotfiles
```

Pay attention to the prompts if you have conflicting files.

Credit
===
Much of it is adopted from others.  See individual files for credits.

Contact me if you see your code as these dotfiles have gradually grown.  I'll add you to credits.

Feedback
===
Let me know on Twitter [ZPH](http://twitter.com/_ZPH) or [Blog](https://blog.xargs.io) if you're using these files. I'd love to hear about it :) and get pull requests.
